# Locality

Location based customization of your dotfiles :volcano: 


# TODO: 

First
- Default file path should be calling file (if sourced)
- Parsing locality from some config file
- (maybe) add sourcing as well?
- Tests, as always, check bats-core

More
- Use default environment vars as locality, with arguments
- Load multiple locality files at once
